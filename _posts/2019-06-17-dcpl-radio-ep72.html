Everything piles on during Gemini season. Live radio is always fun, especially when chatting with Robert LaRose of DCPL Northeastern branch and Mary Kidd about Preserve This Podcast</a> and audio file formats. Gearing up for a roadtrip down i-95 but also happy to be on summer break. More python and more dance soon.

Am also thinking a lot about this quote that everyone already knows, apparently: <em>"Words familiar in olden times are now archaisms; so also the names of those whose praises were hymned in bygone days are now in a sense archaisms; Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus; a little after, Scipio too and Cato; then also Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all things quickly fade and turn to fable, and quickly, too, utter oblivion covers them like sand. And this I say of those who shone like stars to wonder at; the rest, as soon as the breath was out of their bodies were 'unnoticed and unwept.' And what after all is everlasting remembrance? Utter vanity. What then is that about which a man ought to spend his pain? This one thing: right understanding, neighbourly behavior, speech which would never lie, and a disposition welcoming all which comes to pass, as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from a source and fountain like itself. All is ephemeral, both what remembers and what is remembered."</em> --Marcus Aurelius
