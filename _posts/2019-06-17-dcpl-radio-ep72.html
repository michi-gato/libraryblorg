Everything piles on during Gemini season. Live radio is always fun, especially when chatting with Robert LaRose of DCPL Northeastern branch and Mary Kidd about Preserve This Podcast</a> and audio file formats. Gearing up for a roadtrip down i-95 but also happy to be on summer break. More python and more dance soon.
