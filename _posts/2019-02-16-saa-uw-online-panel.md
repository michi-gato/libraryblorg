title: recap of SAA-UW decolonizing archives online panel 
date: 2019-02-16

I wrote a _Sparknotes_ version of the _Decolonizing the Archives_ online panel for the Society of American Archivists-University of Washington Student Chapter. Orginally posted on [SAA-UW's Wordpress site](https://saauw.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/recap-saa-uw-decolonizing-archives-online-panel/) but [here it is on Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190310153943/https://saauw.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/recap-saa-uw-decolonizing-archives-online-panel/) for good measure. 

Since May 2018, [the 3-2-1 backup plan](http://preservethispodcast.org/assets/PreserveThisPodcast_Zine_Online.pdf#page=10) has been drilled into my daily practice, so in light of _walk the walk_, _talk the talk_, and 
_practice what you preach_, here is the full article, again:

On February 11, 2019, in under 1.5 hours, SAA-UW hosted an informal online video and phone chat with five rad archivists who dedicate their work to represent the marginalized stories in our historical records. Thanks to the talented wrangling skills from our Diversity Officer, Joan Hua, and Distance Liaison Officer, Kelli Yakabu, over two dozen students and five awe-inspiring archivists shared thoughts about diversity and representation in the archives (e.g. in the stacks and amongst the people creating the systems).

For those who are reading this 91 days after the event, and missed the recording, here are the CliffsNotes → 
###The panel line-up###
Featuring five archivists coming from vastly different archives—from large private university libraries, public university, regional archives association, and a national museum. Here are their bios:

**Dorothy Berry** is the Digital Collections Program Manager at Houghton Library, Harvard University. She graduated from the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology and the School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at Indiana University. She currently serves as Chair of the Archivists and Archives of Color Section of the Society of American Archivists. Her work focuses on the intersections of information science and African American history, working to increase access through digital projects and descriptive equity.

**Steven Bingo** is the Digital Projects Archivist at Eastern Washington University and currently serves as the coordinator for the Northwest Archivists Native American Collections Roundtable. His work has focused on collections illuminating communities in the Inland Northwest, including Japanese American populations in Yakima and Spokane, immigrant communities in late-19th century Montana, and the temporary band of laborers who helped build Grand Coulee Dam. Steven has also worked on projects such as the Plateau People’s Web Portal, the Sustainable Heritage Network, and a Japanese American taxonomy project organized by Densho.

**Mariecris Gatlabayan** is Northwest Archivists’ secretary and was responsible for advocating and creating the Northwest Archivists’ Native American Collections Roundtable. She is also the Filipino American National Historical Society’s (FANHS) Secretary and functions as their archives consultant. FANHS is an all-volunteer run organization that has the mission to collect, preserve, and share the history of Filipino Americans. As part of her role as an archivists consultant, Mariecris created an AirTable database in which they can catalog files in their National Pinoy Archives. Through her experience with FANHS, she has come to learn the importance of community archives and how an archivist’s role can evolve into a postcustodial model. She continues to build a relationship with the FANHS executive director and trustees to provide her services in the face of trust and resource issues. Currently she works as an Archivist at Vulcan Inc.

**Michael Pahn** is the Head Archivist at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian Archive Center, located in the museum’s Cultural Resources Center in Suitland, Maryland. Michael began at NMAI in 2003 as Media Archivist, and been NMAI’s Head Archivist since 2014, during which time he has overseen major improvements to online access to NMAI’s archival collections. Michael is Vice Chair of the Smithsonian Music Executive Committee and is a Past Chair of the Society of American Archivists’ Indigenous Archives Section Steering Committee. He has a BA in Anthropology from the University of Pittsburgh and an MLS from the University of Maryland. His prior professional experiences include Save Our Sounds Project Librarian at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, and Librarian at The Nature Conservancy.

**Annie Tang** is the head of Special Collections at Chapman University in Southern California. She was previously the Processing Archivist at Johns Hopkins University, as well as a member of its Diversity Committee, which encouraged more inclusive library recruitment methods. Prior to Hopkins, Annie was an archivist at UC Santa Cruz, processing papers regarding the 1960s and 1970s Black, Native, and Asian American Power Movements. An MLIS graduate of UCLA, she recently served as chair of the Toward Culturally Competent (Re)Description panel at SAA 2018. Annie loves a good bowl of Vietnamese pho, discussing intersectionality, and talking about the differences between East and West Coast weather.

###Context to collections and resources###
Dorothy B. and Annie T. mentioned realistic and eye-opening perspectives about using the terminology “decolonizing” in relation to the archives. 
>"The only way we can really Decolonize the Archives is to completely dismantle the system… To have a nine to five job to work full time, you know, to have a salary to have benefits, you unfortunately have to be part of that system… as much as you can with your soul intact… for me the decolonizing archive is practicing as much as possible, as realistically as you can… in a non-white non-Western centric way of processing of collection, management… I especially have done this with with metadata and description.” 

Back in Summer 2018, they were co-panelists for an [SAA annual conference session titled, Toward Culturally Competent Archival(Re)Description of Marginalized Histories](https://archives2018.sched.com/event/ESld/101-toward-culturally-competent-archival-redescription-of-marginalized-histories), which covers various ways archivists have implemented practices in their archives to be more respectfully representative and inclusive. Their slides are also [publicly available as a PDF](https://schd.ws/hosted_files/archives2018/b4/s101_slides.pdf). (I attended this session and I can attest it has made me more hopeful that we can all work together to make archives less Western-centric).

Steve B. mentioned a beautiful online platform that is the culmination of an on-going community archive project: [Plateau Peoples' Web Portal](https://plateauportal.libraries.wsu.edu) managed by Kim Christian. In this case, Washington State University’s Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation, [Mukurtu.org](http://mukurtu.org/) and in partnership with WSU’s Native American Programs worked with indigenous people and 
>“groups within the Columbia Plateau on the opportunity to respond to descriptions… often times the descriptions aren’t so much offensive as just, you know, they’re lacking because [the archivists] don’t have the background… there are technologies that help people respond to descriptions that have been passed down… it gives communities that chance to respond and describe it in a way that supports their cultural heritage.”

The community archives discussion reminded me of this other presentation I saw at the [ACRL/NY Symposium in December 2018](https://acrlny2018symposium.wordpress.com/program/). Here is another great presentation about how to develop and sustain a community-driven archive: [Engaging, Educating, and Empowering: Developing Community-Driven Archival Collections](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z3RsqUNRDxusu5jInjmsGW1OAOy6otes/view) by Nancy Godoy, Arizona State University; Lorrie McAllister, Arizona State University.

Fellow MLIS classmate, Rose (Dragon, she/her) shared a story and question that hit close to home—about living archives. She asked the panelists how do 
>“communities pass down information and how some things cannot be written down… there's certain information that can't be really shared unless you see it live action like there's recipes that I have to stare at my mom [and] sit there watching.”
The big takeaway? All panelists agreed that, in these cases, we need to set aside the fact that archives is a formalized practice and that we can all create an archive just by voice recording family members’ stories. Keeping it that simple will save the stories, just as well. 
Mariecris G. chimed in and taught us all about 
>“talk story. Everybody likes to tell a story. If you just get a group of them, then you will get so much information and stuff that you, you know, never thought you wanted to hear.” 
With their permission, record it!

Fellow UW iSchooler Julie Jones (she/her) shared a collection that she recently researched for her Capstone project: [Smithsonian National Ethnobotanical Herbarium Online](https://neho.si.edu). 
She was 
>“shocked at how little [the collection] has essentially no indigenous nomenclature in any of their database of all the plants”. She then brought up a valid point that “the whole concept of an herbarium is inherently colonial because it essentially it stems from explorers… naming [“discoveries”] after the explorers themselves… even though oftentimes discovery was only done that with the help of Native folks”.
Dorothy B. added on 
>“whose scientific names?” 
Let’s keep asking ourselves that as we start sifting through collections.

Annie T. shared a link to this free toolkit, geared towards digital libraries: [The Design for Diversity Learning Toolkit: Exploring Education And Advocacy For More Inclusive Information Systems](https://des4div.library.northeastern.edu/)
>“[I]t has paper by [Annie] about archival description for digital collections and” walks through indigenous collections from Montana “a lot of people contributed to”. 

Thanks for joining! Share your thoughts and/or desires on what other informal chats you’d like to have on this [SAA-UW Event Suggestion Box Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBCVqvMVYCaWr7yfQpb47CBZaq2eykSuhTzksLQUzK_kHHiA/viewform). This will help us with future programming.

Follow-up notes from the speakers:

From Michael Pl — [The William Wildschut photograph collection at NMAI](https://sova.si.edu/record/NMAI.AC.001.033)

From Steve B.
>A few sample records from the Plateau Peoples' Web Portal:
Root Gathering Bag. The main page has the museum description, an example of what Michael was talking about. It's not inaccurate, it just doesn't support the continuation/ preservation of indigenous knowledge. If you select the Confederation Tribes of Warm Springs, you can read some descriptions by Warm Springs elders, as well as a video where an elder enacts a story inscribed on the bag.
>A Literary Society Group at Chemawa. Again, the schitsu' umsh description provides information about the photograph that supports Coeur d'Alene history.
Tule Basket Weaving Demonstration. This is part of a three part series of videos on the use of tule reeds by the Coeur d'Alene. I think this is an example of what Mariecris and Dorothy were suggesting to Rose. I think this is part of a larger program to pass on the knowledge.
>One point to emphasize, something that I've heard Kim Christen and others make is that the CMS used for the Portal, Mukurtu CMS, is a tool that helps support a relationship that produces the rich descriptions you see. Had the folks at WSU put up the Portal without the active collaboration with the Plateau nations, the project would be a shell of what it currently is. In other words, the "if you build it, they will come" model is often not enough. I imagine many in your chapter have already read this, but here is Kim's article about the Portal. 
Also, Lotus Wisla-Norton and Michael Wynne co-wrote a chapter in the book Personal Digital Archiving. There's much more to say about it, so I'd definitely recommend these for further reading for folks interested in the project.
