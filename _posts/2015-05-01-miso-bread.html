There was a time when I thought I could be the neighborhood baker, like <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i>.</p>

<p>Moving from California Bay Area to New York City left me in a sourdough drought. I missed the thick crunchy toasted outer layer, and then biting into the fluffy tangy soury bready innards. This city of world-reknowned restauranteurs had flour water compared to the yeasty loaves in the Bay. And thus, Taaffe Loaffes was born. This 24 hour-rise no-knead bread made me better human being. </p>

<p>Our dough was featured one the Silver Spork News: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528004007/http://silversporknews.com/2015/05/01/baking-a-miso-bread-masterpiece-with-taaffe-loaffes/" target = "_blank"> Baking a Miso Bread Masterpiece with Taaffe Loaffes</a> by Nandini Ahuja

<h3>Miso Bread Recipe</h3>
(adapted from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150630225024/http://luckypeach.com/recipes/miso-sourdough-bread/">Ben Wolfe’s Miso Sourdough Bread recipe</a>)
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour (enriched, preferably unbleached)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups tap water</li>
<li>4 +/- 2 ish tablespoon lower sodium miso (play with it)</li>
<li>olive or vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>After dinner is done, we mix 3 cups flour + 1 teaspoon salt + 1/4 teaspoon yeast in a large bowl.</p>

<p>In a smaller bowl, dissolve the miso paste in water. It’s best to first add just a bit of the water with all of the miso, then liquify, then mix in the remainder of the water. It’s easier to smoosh miso chunks when you can see them.</p>

<p>Pour the miso water onto the dry stuff. With a fork or wooden spoon, pull areas of dry into wet until it’s roughly even, then stir it for a few strokes. Once it’s mostly soaked up, press the dough together to fill up cracks and to gather the last of the powdery pieces. We wish we could be as pro as Lahey’s one hand stir technique. Don’t worry about kneading it a few presses, just to get the dough in one piece.</p>

<p>Put the dough in a well-oiled medium bowl/container. You can sprinkle flour on top of the dough and cover the bowl with a clean towel to raise the dough in a warm and happy environment, but since we often have to bring it to another place after work we invested in plastic containers with covers (like this Cambro container) for easy transportation. They rise fine with a lid on.</p>

<p>After 18-20 hours, smell the yeasty aroma and scoop out dough onto a floured work space. Fold four corners of the dough towards the center to create a plump round heap and loosely wrap the dough pile in the towel; make sure it is well floured between the towel and dough. Let the wrap sit for 2 hours: this is the Second Rising.</p>

<p>At ~1.5 hours preheat the oven to 475°F with a Dutch oven style pot and lid inside</p>.

<p>After the Second Rising, place the dough in the hot pot, cover with lid, and bake for 30 minutes. Bake without the lid for 7-13 more minutes.</p>

<p>Remove the bread from pot and let cool before slicing.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t let it rise for too long in the first rise (e.g. 36 hours), else everything will starve out and not do the Second Rise. 1.5 to 2 hours for the Second Rise yields the same rising results.</li>
<li>1/4 to 1teaspoon yeast doesn’t seem to change anything</li>
<li>Kneading a bit at the beginning doesn’t seem to change anything.</li>
<li>The amount of miso seems to help how much the dough will rise (i.e. bread fluffiness). The most we’ve tried is ~7 tablespoons- hella dank and rises like a balloon (kinda).</li>
</ul>
