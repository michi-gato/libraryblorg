That one time I thought I could be the neighborhood baker.</p>
<p>Moving from California Bay Area to New York City left me in sourdough drought. I missed the thick crunchy toasted outer layer, and then biting into the fluffy tangy soury bready innards. This city of world-reknowned restauranteurs had flour water compared to the yeasty loaves in the Bay. And thus, Taaffe Loaffes was born. This 24 hour-rise no-knead bread made me better human being. </p>

<p>Here's that one time the Silver Spork News loved our dough: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528004007/http://silversporknews.com/2015/05/01/baking-a-miso-bread-masterpiece-with-taaffe-loaffes/" target = "_blank"> Baking a Miso Bread Masterpiece with Taaffe Loaffes</a> by Nandini Ahuja
