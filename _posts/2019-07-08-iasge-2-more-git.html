Wrote a second and third update for the Investigating & Archiving the Scholarly Git Experience project:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://investigating-archiving-git.gitlab.io/updates/git-moving-into-open-scholarship/"> Git Moving into Open Scholarship</a> (2019-06-10) : This one was more of a reflection piece on finishing my first year as a part-time MLIS and then realizing the importance of approaching the rest of my life in-line with the open/libre movement (Maybe sometimes just open though because pure open/libre is still a wip for me). And what better way to advocate for openness than to discover all of Git's potential in owership, creation, preservation, and independence.</li>
<li><a href="https://investigating-archiving-git.gitlab.io/updates/git-hosting-platforms-in-scholarship/"> Scholarly Version Control, Community, & Method Tracking with Git Hosting Platforms (GHPs)</a> (2019-07-05) : This is the first of three in a series about different ways researchers use Git hosting platforms within their daily scholarly activities. This is also my attempt to coin an acronym, unless it has already been taken => <u>GHP</u>. There might be too many collaged shadowed screenshots here--oops.</li></ul>
