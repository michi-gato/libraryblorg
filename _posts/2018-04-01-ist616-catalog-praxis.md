My first MLIS course was with Syracuse University's iSchool: IST616 Information Organization and Access in Winter 2018. After learning about the theories and standards behind library and archive cataloging, a classmate and I created a mock-public library website highlighting a special collection. The procedures, policiies, and samples of MARC and [Resource, Description, and Access (RDA)](https://www.rdatoolkit.org/) records of the special objects are included on the site:

<h3>[Cataloging Our Cat Collection](https://cat-alog.github.io/)</h3>

Suprise, the site is built on Jekyll Github Pages, and the [repo is available here](https://github.com/cat-alog/cat-alog.github.io).
