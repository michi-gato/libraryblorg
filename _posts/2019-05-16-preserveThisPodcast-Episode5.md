My voice talks about a project I've been working on: [Preserve This Podcast](http://preservethispodcast.org/). I spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow and GitHub enthusiast blogs to understand how to freely host and distribute a podcast, using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/index.php). 

I talk about it on Preserve This Podcast's [Episode 5: RSS Resuscitations](https://radiopublic.com/preserve-this-podcast-WDJY3A/ep/s1!7df2c). Listen to all of the episodes!

Gratitude to the PTP team <3
