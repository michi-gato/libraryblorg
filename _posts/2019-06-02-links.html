Krukowski makes us consider sound—what we hear, what we don’t, how, and why—as a means of listening but also, perhaps, of resisting."

<em>Despite the seemingly unprecedented supply of music, Krukowski suggests that internet companies, like Spotify and Amazon, "are replacing the freedom and chaos of the internet at large, with the control and predictability of their programs.” In other words, they generally provide access to art that we are or would be comfortable with, and they otherwise restrict or obscure alternatives. “When you go into a bookstore, or record store, or library—any physical space devoted to information,” Krukowski writes, “you enter another world . . . But when you open a browser—it’s an irony that’s the word, isn’t it?—that relationship to information is reversed. It conforms to you."</em> < a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190713210902/https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-power-and-the-noise-meyer?utm_source=Baffler+Readers&utm_campaign=d373768a47-05072019_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3541d01f8a-d373768a47-46753055"target=
