Cảm ơn means "thank you" in Vietnamese. (For many reasons, I'm trying to learn Vietnamese through Duolingo. If any one has any other low-cost, easy to onboard into daily life ways to learn a second language, please do let me know).

This year, I was fortunate enough to be a [scholarship recipient](https://2019.code4lib.org/general-info/scholarships) for the 2019 Code4Lib gathering this past February in San Jose, CA. This opportunity was especially close to my heart because San Jose _is a city where I grew up visiting and knowing as the Little Saigon of Northern California. It would be a fulfilling circle to be amongst fellow librarian technologists in the city where my parents found their own community_ in culture and in career.

### Speaking there
With the encouragement from [a wise friend](https://ashleyblewer.com/), I presented a [lightning talk on Day 2](https://wiki.code4lib.org/Code4Lib2019_Lightning_Talks#Day_2_-_February_21.2C_2019). In [this short audiovisual clip](https://youtu.be/GDC7nxtdG3s?t=920), I introduced and shared the work I've been doing this past year with [Preserve This Podcast](http://preservethispodcast.org/). This is the project that motivated me to quit my full-time gig and finally transition my day-to-day dedications. I'm quite nervous in this last minute presentation, but I plan to push myself to present and share more with each gathering and/or conference I am so lucky to join in the future.

### Reminders that resonated
One of my biggest takeawys from Code4Lib 2019:"Nothing about us, without us"
I was only recently introduced to this phrase from a recent assigned reading in my current University of Washington MLIS course, Design Methods for Librarianship: Constanza-Chock, S. (2018). Design Justice: towards an intersectional feminist framework for design theory and practice. In proceedings, "Catalyst", Design Research Society 2018, University of Limerick. (pp. 1-14).

>"The key lessons include: involving members of the community that is most directly affected by the issue that you are focusing on is crucial, both because it’s ethical, and also because the tacit and experiential knowledge of community members is sure to produce ideas, approaches and innovations that a non-member of the community would be very unlikely to come up with. It is also possible to create formal community accountability mechanisms in design processes." (pg. 10)

This is a reoccuring theme in the past three library and archive-related conferences I've attended, but it is still important to reiterate and Code4Lib included inspiring speakers and presentation topics to support this theme.

Cheers to more Code4Lib attendances in the future.
