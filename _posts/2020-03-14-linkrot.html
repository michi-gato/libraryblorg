<p>Recording from !!Con West was originally livestreamed on instagram by Ramin Rahni.</p>

<p>linkRot is an intermedia performance piece simulating the physical euphoria that internet content creation permits into the digital decay that comes with/out feelings of loss.</p>
<p>This is a dance inspired by broadcast audio through RSS, technology obsolescence, Git version controls, and 3-2-1 backups. Sounds recorded from earlier talks will be regenerated to create auditory memories of early digital networking and are made tangible through isolated limbed branches that build to a feeling of potential completion. It soon breaks down as segments are gradually destroyed due to algorithmically-controlled centralized over-saturation. This is an exploration of existing digital archiving techniques that are missing components to recreate the full computational environment.</p>

linkRot premiered at <a href="https://radicalnetworks.org/archives/2019/">Radical Networks (2019-10-19)</a> at Prime Produce in New York, NY. Its second iteration, <i>linkRot!! Dancing the patterns of digital decay</i> was performed at <a href-"http://bangbangcon.com/west/speakers/#sarah-nguyen">!!Con West (2020-03-01)</a> at Baskin Engineering UCSC in Santa Cruz, CA.

<h3>Transcript of the post-performance talk at !!Con West 2020:</h3>
Thank you OK. Hi! OK, this is going to breathey because catching my breath. My name is Sarah Nguyen. Thank you for watching and being a part of linkRot: dancing the digital decay
</p>
I'd like to start with a big thank you to Ramin Rahni. He made the music to accompany this piece. The music was streamed from Brooklyn, NY [on <a href="https://www.nycmesh.net/">NYC Mesh</a>] and live generated off of his octotrack. It was based off of yesterday's talks. So you might have recognized some of the the voices throughout the piece.
</p>
We rely on links in order to share information, make data into something understandable, and create some sort of relatable knowledge base. When these relationships are broken, we lose access to data, information is incomplete, and knowledge is lost. 
This can be seen through 404 error pages, broken redirects, irreproducible systems, and decaying magnetic tape.
</p>
This performance is an analogy for the bit rot and obsolescence that can happen over time as we upgrade and update technologies. 
</p>
Yesterday, I recorded the the audio from all of the talks and sent it to Ramin. Thank you all for letting me use that. CC-By, gotchu there. And, the music was intentionally made start off as if we're building the internet. It gradually builds up to represent the supposed utopia of links, relations, and connections. Thhe music gradually breaks down as people begin to exploit and disregard as those connections decay, and become obsolete. The piece ends with a storm of irrelevant connections that should not have been formed, and closes with a lone hard drive spinning distant memories.
</p>
I danced this because physical movement and dance is the most ephemeral medium, to me at least. We cannot easily recreate, document or back up a muscle tone, a dancer's breath, wherever that breath is, or the dancer's relationship to the audience.
</p>
I'm a graduate student for libraries, information science, and archives. And, I'm interested in the rate of obsolencense of our digital ephemera and how we can or if we even should  emulate or recreate technologies. I'm curious about what are the systems, codebase, or environments that are needed to ensure people have access to this knowledge in the future? How can we document and package digital objects so that even aliens in the future are able to reproduce what has brought us joy?
</p>
In the end, it's also important to consider that not everything needs to be preserved and everyone and everything has the right to be forgotten.
</p>
Thank you so much for watching and listening. And support the <a href="https://payusmoreucsc.com/">UCSC student strike</a>. Thanks!
