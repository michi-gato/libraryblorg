<p>
It was a golden day of birth. The day which one turns the same age as the number of one's day of birth. Therefore, I decided to do a test run for my ideal funeral by curating a show where my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200201215119/https%3A%2F%2Fgath.io%2F4GGG_ZyFu">friends performed dance and shared their fine art</a> for me on January 31, 2020 at the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) in Hell's Kitchen in New York City.</p>
<p>
Through this, I hope to be able to spark more performances and artist residencies at the METRO space. Bridging creators with archivists and librarians. Message me if you're interested in activating archives through performance (a la Carbone 2015, NYLPA, etc.).

<b>About the artists</b>
</p>
Hunter Darnell is a Brooklyn-based dance artist mostly interested in improvisation, sensory and somatic based work. Though Hunter works primarily with dance/movement as a medium, they can also be found writing poetry and exploring multidisciplinary collaborations.
</p>
Alex Escobedo is a Latinx + POZ multi-disciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Alex is transfronterizx originally from the Tijuana / San Diego border. Perhaps not-so coincidently, their work talks in time, of time and about time. For example, drawings and paintings are dances in the act of drawing or painting. They are a testament to mark-making but also simultaneously wrestle with death. In all the mix, Escobedo concerns themselves with voice, self-imaging, storytelling and performance. insta: @j.a.escobedo
</p>
Mitchell is a musician molded by the suburban landscapes of the Salt River Valley.
</p>
Sarah Nguyen is an aquarius asking how human behavior interacts with information, open technologies, and dance.
</p>
Winter Somnolence is a feeling, of strong desire towards coziness and comfort. They practice playing with light and water in an 8 x 10 cabin on the borderlands of Bedford Stuyvesant and Bushwick. No two works are ever alike.
</p>
Carter Shocket is investigating Trans Sentience. How does one become alive in a body? When does a vehicle become part of who you are? Could the answer lie in motion? As a dance maker, Carter attempts to attach his sense of self to his own body. Through archiving and recreating past iterations of his body in motion, Carter layers versions of semi-sentient selves.
